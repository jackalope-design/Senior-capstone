# Senior Capstone

Made for the class: **CSC 495 - Senior Capstone**

Hey!
Welcome to my capstone program!

I wanted to make the program easy to use, so I put it in a .jar. You need to know a thing or two...

1) Run this on the java 8 JDK. 
	+ Do not use openjdk8, it lacks some required dependencies

2) If you need to switch your default java version use "$update-java-alternatives --list" (Linux)
	+ Not 100% sure how to switch JDK on Osx and Windows... It might be the same on Mac

3) run the .jar file by using "java -jar JavaCanvas.jar" (Linux/Osx)


How to use the software:


1) Prepare a folder with only .java files

2) Run .jar file

3) Select canvas customization options from interface
	+ Non-selected options will crash the program

4) Select the folder you prepared earlier from the interface 

5) The resulting image file will be named "[folder-name] img.png" and placed in the parent directory

*Attached to this reposotory is the critisism collected by my peers and test files. 

The program should produce something like this:
![img](ex.png)
